## Software

autoTS relies on (and has extended) the [WINGS workflow system](https://www.wings-workflows.org).
The methods are available through the [Pyleoclim package](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/tree/master).
Workflow strategies and test datasets are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/autoTS).
