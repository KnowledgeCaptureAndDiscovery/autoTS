# Outlier detection

Pyleoclim relies on outlier detection through clustering, using the silhouette score as the optimization criterion. 

* DBSCAN: Runs through an example of the optimization algorithm using pseudo-data (colored noise with superimposed periodicities and real paleoclimate datasets
* Kmeans: Runs through an example of the optimization algorithm using pseudo-data (colored noise with superimposed periodicities and real paleoclimate datasets
* LOF: (WIP)
* CBLOF: Dumped for now since it seems to be using Kmeans instead of KNN

The Outlier Function notebook describes the integration of the various functions in [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/).
