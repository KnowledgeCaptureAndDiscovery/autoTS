# Workflows

This folder contains a collection of notebooks describing workflows that will be
implemented in WINGS.

* Spectral Workflow: describes the steps for workflow analysis, including saving in JSON format. Each cell in the notebook is meant to emulate a workflow component for WINGS [Ready to use]
* Spectral Workflow Test: Add a cost function to spectral workflow to characterize how well the workflow is able to capture the original periodocoties [beta]
* Wavelet workflow: workflow for wavelet analysis [in prep]
